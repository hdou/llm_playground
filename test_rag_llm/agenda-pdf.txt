The Finish Is What Matters: Get ROI in Record Time with a Fast and
Precise Material Removal and Finishing Process
Michael Haas, Vice President America, FerRobotics
Topic(s): Material Removal, Grinding & Abrasives Robotics: Applications, Systems & Innovations The
Business Case for Automation
Traditional sanding and grinding methods, often involve multiple steps and can be time-consuming.
Advancements in technology have led to the development of innovative approaches that offer significant
improvements in efficiency and quality. By harnessing the intelligence of an Active Force Control and the
power of a high-speed operation these tasks can be transformed into a precise finishing process.
The Role of Force Control and Speed
Our approach revolves around maintaining a constant contact force. Unlike other solutions, this system
ensures that the abrasive tool exerts a consistent pressure on the workpiece at any time and any
circumstance, regardless of variation in robot speed, orientation or any other parameter like material or shape.
Constant force control allows to play with several parameters such as speed, feed rate and RPM, abrasive
media, ... without impacting the contact force. Observations show that higher process speeds, coupled with a
consistent contact force, yield the most superior surface finishes and in the end the interaction and increase of
these factors allows for:
Reduced cycle times: By moving the abrasive tool across the surface at higher speeds while maintaining
optimal pressure, we achieve significantly faster material removal rates.
Superior surface finishes: The combination of speed and precise force control results in a smoother, more
uniform finish that eliminates the need for additional polishing or finishing steps.
Extended abrasive media life: The consistent and optimized working conditions prolong the lifespan of
abrasive media, reducing operational costs.
The Economics of Precision Finishing
The benefits of our approach extend beyond improved product quality. By accelerating the finishing process
and eliminating the need for secondary operations, this offers a compelling return on investment (ROI). Those
systems equipped with real contact force outperform other automated solutions due to:
Higher throughput: The system's ability to achieve optimal results in shorter cycle times means you can
process more parts in less time.
Reduced labor costs: Faster throughput through the automated system with less manual finishing needs
decreases the labor cost per part.
Improved product quality: The consistent, high-quality finishes produced by the system reduces theamount of defects and rework.
In essence, this approach of faster processing redefines automated finishing. By combining high speed,
precise force control, and a focus on achieving a perfect finish in a single process, results in solutions that are
faster and more cost-effective than traditional methods. The result is a significant improvement in overall
manufacturing efficiency and a reduction in time-to-market.

Automated Visual Inspection at Every Stage of Manufacturing
Rajesh Iyengar, Co-Founder and CEO, Lincode Labs Inc.
Topic(s): Machine Vision, Imaging & Inspection
The presentation will address the current visual inspection practices in the manufacturing sector and highlight
the need for a more advanced approach. Currently, many manufacturing companies rely on manual inspection
processes, which are prone to human error and inconsistencies. Visual inspections conducted by human
inspectors are very time-intensive and have limited data tracking. Factors such as fatigue, distractions, and
varying levels of expertise can lead to inaccurate assessments. Additionally, some companies have
implemented machine vision systems that utilize golden template matching, but this approach has limitations
in detecting defects accurately. They often require expensive equipment to be implemented, which can pose a
significant financial burden for companies. Moreover, machine vision systems are typically rule-based,
requiring extensive system integration efforts. This integration can be complex and time-consuming, adding to
the overall implementation challenges.
The presentation will introduce AI-based visual inspection as a revolutionary solution to these challenges.
AI-based visual inspection leverages the power of artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze visual data and
identify defects with remarkable precision. By incorporating deep learning techniques, the system can
continuously enhance its performance over time through training and exposure to a wide range of component
data. Compared to manual inspection or traditional machine vision systems, AI-based visual inspection offers
higher accuracy, reliability, and efficiency.
The presentation will also discuss the advantages of implementing AI-based visual inspection in
manufacturing processes. By automating the inspection process in every manufacturing stage, companies can
eliminate the need for manual labor, thereby improving productivity and minimizing production downtime.
During the presentation, specific examples and case studies will be provided to demonstrate the effectiveness
of AI-based visual inspection.

Make Your Cobot Application Resilient With Off-The-Shelf AI-Driven
Perception
Andrew Pether, AI Applications Lead, R&D Manager, Universal Robots
Topic(s): AI & Smart Automation Collaborative Robotics Machine Vision, Imaging & Inspection Robotics:
Applications, Systems & Innovations
An inherent challenge of a truly collaborative robot application is that sharing a workspace with a human
introduces variability that is very difficult to handle with a robot simply cycling through pre-defined positions
and instructions to complete a task.
AI driven perception is equipping robots with a broad range of capabilities to sense and compensate for
variance in their environment simplifying deployment processes, reducing the need for rigid fixturing, and in
many cases enabling tasks previously deemed unsuitable for automation.
We will explore how off-the-shelf models (as opposed to those trained from scratch for very specific scenarios)
provide capabilities such as deep-learning driven part detection and pose estimation, work cell anomaly
detection and collision aware path planning. These models combined with simple, intuitive user interfaces can
add flexibility and reduce deployment times, benefiting manufacturers across a wide range of industry
segments.
These capabilities are integrated into existing programming paradigms and software development
environments, allowing this enhanced flexibility to be delivered with cycle time and reliability that industry
expects.
Case studies showing real solutions enabled by these approaches will be presented, along with explanations
of how the audience can get started working with AI in robotics without being overwhelmed.Andrew Pether

Mark Peterson, Co-founder and VP Advanced Technology, Theia Technologies
Topic(s): Machine Vision, Imaging & Inspection
Mark Peterson, Co-founder and VP of Advanced Technology at Theia Technologies presents an insightful
case study on Ultra-Wide, No Distortion Lenses Tough Enough for Crash Testing.
In the field of automotive crash testing, high-speed cameras are crucial for capturing and analyzing the
dynamics of impact. Imaging systems require a variety of features to not only withstand violent environments,
but also capture crisp, clear images in challenging light conditions and often in tight spaces, with the precision
needed for accurate crash observation. That’s where Theia Technologies’ lenses with patented Linear Optical
Technology® come in.
Since 2018 Theia’s lenses with patented distortion correction technology have found a home in vehicle crash
testing. The lenses were chosen for their unparalleled wide fields of view from short distances, very low barrel
distortion and high-resolution performance. Theia’s ML183M lens was originally selected for its 1.8 – 3mm
focal range offering up to 120° horizontal field of view with less than 1% barrel distortion and 200 lp/mm
resolution. The lens allows the onboard crash test imaging system to cover the entire width of the vehicle and
its dummy passengers from closer than one half meter. The patented technology uses all optical distortion
correction; no software is required to correct distortion so there is no related latency – the ultra-wide image
keeps straight lines in the object straight in the image in real time.
In 2023 Theia introduced their MY23F 2.3mm 1/1.8” format lens which improves upon these features by
adding ruggedization that allows it to survive vehicle crash testing impacts at 50 miles per hour during sled
tests. The lens has been tested and is certified to withstand shock of up to 50G in each axis as well as
vibration up to 200Hz at 10G.
The patented technology also provides increased edge resolution compared to other wide-angle optics. With
patented Linear Optical Technology™ there are more pixels the farther out to the edge of the image, providing
a better chance of capturing small details all the way out to the edge of the image. Both the ML183 and
MY23F lenses provide 200 lp/mm resolution, enabling capture of high resolution, clear images in this dynamic
crash test environment.
Until recently Theia’s patented Linear Optical Technology® and its advantages had only been available for up
to 1/2.3” image sensors. With the MY23F lens, this technology can now be employed with the larger 1/1.8”
sensors that are popular for their larger pixels, for greater light gathering ability, and dynamic range in
challenging, low light environments.
With its 200lp/mm resolution performance, rugged design, and versatile combination C/M12 mount, the
MY23F lens is without peer in machine vision today. The MY23F’s 116° horizontal field of view and 0.5%
barrel distortion make it the widest, no distortion lens for 1/1.8” imagers on the market today, an excellent
choice to meet the stringent requirements of onboard crash test imaging systems.
Mark Peterson will be exploring these advances, focusing on how Theia’s patented Linear Optical
Technology® is revolutionizing crash testing and beyond.

Smarter Automation Choices for Today’s Manufacturers
Jacob Sanchez, Industry Solutions and Community Development, Igus Inc
Topic(s): Automation Systems, Design & Integration Getting Started with Automation
Imagine what this industry looks like from the outside looking in. GIANT automated assembly cells pick
components for a PCB board assembly that needs to get soldered, inspected, and moved upstream in less
than 7 seconds. Seeing all these crazy fast and highly complex systems makes the idea of automation
impossible or, at the very least, an incredibly risky investment.
This idea of "tech up now, upgrade later" puts fears to rest. In this session, I will talk about how to find YOUR
right process and why you don't always need to jump into a 200,000-dollar cell right off the bat. With "low-cost
automation" solutions and TONS of digital tools now available automating has never been easier than it is right
now. Because anytime, is a good time to automate.

Leveraging Learning Algorithms to Predict Weld Distortion and Residual
Stress in Real-Time
Matthew Robinson, ROS-Industrial Consortium Americas - Program Manager, Southwest Research
Institute
Topic(s): AI & Smart Automation Robotics: Applications, Systems & Innovations
In the fabricated structures community, there is a relationship between how the structure is made and how it
will perform in service. One of the inherent benefits of automation is the consistency of the fabrication process
that robotics afford, such as consistent heat input and process control. Combined with physics-based
simulation and thermomechanical analysis structures maybe effectively optimized. However, the consistency
that is possible with the application of robotic welding is compromised as the components to be fabricated vary
in their shape and how they fit together. This input variation often results in distortion and residual stress
profiles that are not intended. Recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence enable the
understanding of a presented assembly variation and update of the welding plan in near real-time relative to
that part condition. These developments would enable the target processes to be optimized and executed as if
the physics-based simulation and optimization were computationally feasible. This takes advantage of both
new approaches for machine learning based frameworks, as well as the ability to execute at the rate of
production, leading to improved operational efficiencies and optimized fabricated products. This talk seeks to
share progress in current work that seeks to apply this hybrid physics-based simulation with a novel learning
framework that seeks to understand presented articles, how they deviate from plan and update welding plans
on the fly to optimize measured distortion and residual stress. The goal is to create a system that may be
added to welding systems that enable dynamic planning as presentations and conditions change in the real
world, thereby making the upfront simulation work more valuable in the production phase, benefitting
structures and shipbuilding fabricators as well as others concerned with as-fabricated quality.

Beyond the Labor: Understanding Robot ROI from Production to Profits
Scott Marsic, Group Product Manager, Epson Robots
Topic(s): Robotics: Applications, Systems & Innovations The Business Case for Automation
The decision to move from a manual to an automated process has historically been a laborious, lengthy, and
capital-intensive endeavor. Calculating the return on investment (ROI) of such a project is critical to the
decision-making process. Companies beginning their automation journey tend to look at robots as a 1 to 1
replacement for their workforce leading to expensive over-tooled and over-automated processes. Focusing
solely on labor replacement can lead companies to vastly undervalue some of the less obvious cost savings
created by the switch to robotics.
In this presentation, we will be discussing some of the best practices and common pitfalls to avoid when
calculating the ROI of a robotic implementation, including:
Efficient system design for a high-mix manufacturing environment
Cost benefits from increased production and decreased waste
Indirect cost benefits generated from increased worker satisfaction and safety
Long-term cost savings from greater traceability, product consistency and re-deployability
By considering these concepts, we can move toward considering robots as part of an overall process
improvement opportunity versus simply as a direct replacement to workers. Doing so brings into consideration
improvements to the production environment, increased product quality, and enhanced company profitability.
Ultimately a refocused ROI calculation will help companies pivot from mid-line labor expenses to top-line
revenue and bottom-line profitability.Scott Marsic

AI-Powered Digital Twins for Boosting Performance of Smart Robotic Cells
Satyandra K. Gupta, Co-Founder & Chief Scientist, GrayMatter Robotics
Topic(s): AI & Smart Automation Robotics: Applications, Systems & Innovations Simulation and Digital
Twins
Many manufacturing companies are facing an acute shortage of qualified workers. Deploying robotic cells is a
potential solution to address this challenge. Historically robots have been deployed only in mass production
applications in manufacturing. A large fraction of manufacturing is classified as high-mix manufacturing where
a large variety of products are produced in small quantities. Manually programming robots is not a viable
solution in high-mix manufacturing applications. We need smart robotic cells to make them useful in high-mix
manufacturing applications.AI-powered digital twins are ushering a new era of manufacturing by lowering costs, reducing errors,
improving quality, increasing performance, and reducing the environmental footprint. This presentation will
begin with an overview of digital twin technology that can be used to significantly improve performance of
smart robotic cells. A digital twin is a digital counterpart of a real-world system. The digital twin performs
continuous model updates using sensor data to mirror the current state of the physical system. Therefore,
information flows from the physical system to the digital twin. A digital twin is also used to influence the
operation of the physical system. Therefore, information also flows from the digital twin to the physical system.
This two-way information flow makes digital twins different from purely digital models.
The next part of this presentation will describe how digital twins are being used in smart robotic cells. Digital
twins are being used to provide information to task planners and schedulers to make decisions about the next
tasks to perform based on the current state of the cell. Digital twins also enable monitoring the performance of
the cell in real-time and use this data to predict when maintenance is needed, reducing unexpected downtime
and preventing machine breakdowns. Digital twins are being used for identification of defects and perform
real-time quality control. By analyzing manufacturing process data, digital twins are able to identify areas for
optimization and recommend changes to realize improvements. Digital twins are able to provide a detailed
record of processing/operating conditions to ensure compliance with relevant regulations. Digital twins can be
used to optimize the manufacturing operations in real-time to support on-demand production of personalized
products in a cost-effective manner.
The final part of the presentation will discuss how AI is adding new capabilities to digital twins. Simulations are
necessary to generate optimal plans for performing autonomous operations. Traditional simulations lack the
speed required when dealing with part models with uncertainties. Machine learning is being used to create
fast simulations based on neural networks, endowing digital twins with new planning and prediction
capabilities. Tool motion cannot be safely executed using position control in the presence of uncertainties. An
AI-based controller needs to be used that uses force feedback to dynamically adapt tool motion to prevent part
damage and maximize tool life. AI-based prognostics and health management can be used by digital twins to
ensure that the onset of adverse events can be automatically detected and corrective actions can be taken.
For example, the digital twin can utilize the force and vision data to determine the cause of rapid tool wear in
robotic finishing and take corrective measures to prevent it.

Doing More with Less Through Simulation
Graham Wloch, Director of Business Development, Visual Components North America Inc.
Topic(s): AI & Smart Automation Automation Systems, Design & Integration Simulation and Digital
Twins
Manufacturing and its challenges are constantly changing and evolving. In the last several years those
challenges have been accelerated and left manufacturers needing new tools to deal with them effectively. The
same old way of doing things simply isn’t good enough anymore and new tools are needed.
Simulation allows you to visualize and better understand your manufacturing process. From capturing
concepts and ideas to get everyone on the same page and to launch continuous improvement projects,
simulation can give you the edge in your industry. By comparing scenarios in the simulation environment, you
can use the statistics Visual Components can generate to make data driven decisions that you are genuinely
confident in.
Want to automate processes but are unsure where to begin? Simulation can show you exactly what the
outcome will be so you can avoid zero net gain or even worse, have unintended consequences because of a
consequential decision. Automation for the sake of automation is never a good idea, but using simulation can
determine the best-case scenario for the improvement of a process.
Robots, AGVs, and AMRs are often the focus of automation which makes sense. People however are just as
important. With the shortage of skilled workers, having them in the right places is critical for a process to
achieve maximum efficiency. Along with those highly coveted skilled workers, the interaction of all resources
is essential when it comes to understanding the complete manufacturing process.
The right automation and the right people in the right places can lead to increased thruput, efficiency, reduced
capital expenditure, a smaller footprint, and an increase the bottom line. Simulation lets you achieve all of
these without having to disrupt your ongoing process.
Simulation is no longer a novelty, but a necessity for companies looking to use all of the tools available to them
to improve processes and do more with less at the same time!

Where Will the Newest Breakthrough in Robots Come From? Where Have
We Been and Where Are We Headed?
George Barbu, Robotic Solutions Manager, EPSON
Topic(s): Emerging Applications Robotics: Applications, Systems & Innovations
They first enriched our lives in the 1980’s when they were first widely deployed in the automotive industry to
help improve the quality of the welding & painting of cars across all the automotive manufacturers in Michigan.
So much so, that General Motors owned their own robotics company called GMF Robotics. They needed this
technology & like many internet companies of today, they wanted to own a company that would give them a
competitive advantage. GM would eventually sell their stake in the robotics venture so the robots could be
sold commercially to other manufacturers. The need for welding and painting robots mostly led to the
development of the 6 axis articulated arm that funded the growth of that industry.
On the other side of the world, Seiko watches needed to develop specialized robots to assembly precision
watches together to improve the throughput and quality of their watches. So they developed a line of robots
that they in turn sold commercially to other manufacturers. The manufacturing need of small precision
assembly led to the development of the Scara robot and funded the growth of that industry.
These are just 2 examples of manufacturers with a unique set of manufacturing needs that resulted in the
development of robotic technology that would help them get a manufacturing advantage in the industry and
that they would eventually sell to other manufacturers.
In todays world, we have a new unique set of problems that are mostly being met by off-the-shelf robotics that
have been around for the better part of 30-40 years. The next evolution of robots could certainly come from
similar type of circumstances that spawned the modern robotics industry.
There is a need for robots to cover a new and set of challenges and a accelerated sensing technology that is
currently being developed by the automotive industry for autonomous vehicles. Will this be the catalyst for the
next generation of robots?
When a 3,000lb car can drive itself on an expressway with sensors, camera’s and GPS navigation – we may
just have the recipe for the next set of robots that could very well be developed outside of the traditional robotsuppliers who faced the same challenges in the 1980’s.
You combine the sensing technology that cost less than $3 to make with a vision system and a localized GPS
& you have the ultimate crash free worker friendly robot. Will an industry needing such a robot be the first to
use & deploy internally & then sell to the rest of the world? This & other ideas could be replicated if the
traditional robot suppliers remain building the same robots they started with.
Lets explore different ideas, concepts, and let our minds wander at what the future may be like and who may
be making the next big idea in robotics a reality.

Accurate Measurements with Machine Vision: Just How Accurate can they
Be?
Perry West, President, Automated Vision Systems, Inc.
Topic(s): Machine Vision, Imaging & Inspection
The ability to make highly accurate measurements with a precision to a small fraction of a pixel is a strength of
machine vision that sets it apart from human vision and many alternative technologies. One consideration is
how to correlate machine vision measurements with alternative measurement techniques. However, there are
still other limits to how accurately and precise machine vision can perform measurements. This talk looks at
these limiting factors. Some of these factors are the dependence on models for the shape of the edge, for the
optical waveform across the edge, the interaction of the lens and image sensor, and for the image sensor
itself. Some of these factors can be addressed with appropriate system design considerations. Still, a few
factors are outside available technology to mitigate and need to be considered when creating a system
specification.
This talk identifies a number of factors that affect the accuracy and precision of measurements and identifies
which can be resolved through careful system design and which are limitations with today’s technology.Perry West
